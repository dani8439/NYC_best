Which restaurant would you like to learn more about?

1. Juliana's - Modern pizzeria with coal-oven pies
  The Zagat Review: 4.7 Food - 3.9 Decor - 4.2 Service

  From “pizza legend” Patsy Grimaldi, this “old-school” joint turns out “premium” pies via a coal oven (“it’s the char!”) in “casual” digs beneath the Brooklyn Bridge; since it “looks like everyone knows”, don’t be surprised to see lines “down the block.”

  What to order:
  No. 2 Pizza - White Pizza - Brookie Bridge Ice Cream Sandwich
